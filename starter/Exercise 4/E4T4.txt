Removing SSH access.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It will not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
IT only control the access to S3 bucket within the network but already exposed unauthorized access would not be solved.

All changes we made will be lost, and all resource will be back to original settings.
