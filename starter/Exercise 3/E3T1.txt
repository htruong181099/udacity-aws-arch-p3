# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
In E3T1_guardduty.png, I already performed the attack simulation but after day of monitoring, AWS GuardDuty failed to identify the brute force attack.
Therefore I can't describe this error. I saw in the knowledge thread, students also encountered same issue,
Apologize for that.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
AWS Guard Duty uses a variety of sources of information to detect potential threats, including: AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
AWS Guard Duty checks for the VPC flow logs, specific for port 22 in this case.
