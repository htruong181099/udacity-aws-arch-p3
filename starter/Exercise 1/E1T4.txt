Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The IAM Role (InstanceRole) is granted unrestricted access to all S3 buckets associated with the instance, thus disregarding the principle of least privilege. 
Roles should be narrowly defined to only include the necessary resources and actions they require.

# Poor practice 2
In the VPC configuration, all route definitions specify the DestinationCidrBlock as 0.0.0.0/0.
If there's a breach within the resource in the subnet configured by this routing table, the attacker can choose to transfer information to any IP address.
